	<h2>Introduction:</h2>
	<p>This is the first assignment provided by the Northampton University for the computing students of CSY1018 module. This report reflect the whole process and phase which comes during the development of a web page like working on group as well as how to provide a validation to css codes or html. From the beginning the process for the web development goes with the group discussion where, many ideas are generated regarding UI design and wireframe for a moody web page. After the designn phase, the whole design is converted into code form in order to use html and css, which is then validated using validators so that unwanted code and tags could be removed ass well as to cover every requirement. However, with the change of time, people changes the way of communication where every one carries mobile in hand so main aim for this project is to make a attractive responsive site too. This report also discusses about the limitation of the page as well as the finding and experience, all the way to develop a friendly web site.</p>


	<h2>UI Design</h2>
	<p>The design for the wireframe are the ideas generated by the group discussion and through certain research on the current UI designs which are implemented randomly for a good sites. As people loves the 3d effet nowadys more than 2d so, using some code with box shadow, it was able to create a 3d theme for every contents in this site. Regarding animations which are mostly liked and attracted by the users are implemented through the group discussion and the activities done from the module using changing radius, transition, transform, keyframe etc for an entertaining website. Beside the png files which are taken out from others work is been implemented for better use as needed for the UI design. Below is one of the best design which is choosen for te animation and buttons for this site mainly in social page to give a friendly and interesting design which is available at:<br>http://devfloat.net/free-css3-buttons-with-nice-effects/

	<h2>My Experience as a Developer</h2>
	<p>As a Web Developer, my experience is very fruit full as i gained so much knowledge about the current UI designs as well as the way how to attract eyes on the site using animation and color effect. By now i am able to create a friendly, entertaining and advance website in context of this era. Using 3d effect was much more easier than i thinked. Using css and html validator, its been so much helpfull in order to know the mistakes and unwanted codes in the files, which is very new to me. Likely, developing a CV was more usefull and helped be alot in dividing sections and linking in a single css as well as creating sub classes inside the main classes. Best part of this assignment was that i got a very good idea about the navigation bar, which was not sure at first but with the time i started coding, somehow such a wonderfull navigation bar is developed. Overall, i got to that how the internet works, how websites are developed and the way to search and do research certain technique and methods.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>With the use of HTML5 and css code for the web designing, it works best with the implementation of different kinds of design and the layout style with some animations which looks too intereting for watching. With the change of time, there been many changes in our life too where people get no time to sit infront of computer whole day to look after the websites and other works. So, such changes in our life is much more easier with the responsive web designs especially made for both pc and mobiles so that individual can look across the world by sitting anywhere through responsive site in phone. And best part is that with the help of new idea of validation to check the error in code, the whole process became easier and error less <br><br>

	As per the requirement of first assignment provided by the Northampton University, all the criteria are fulfilled but there are still some limitations for thsi website regarding animation where its look okay but not that much powerfull the meet the advance animations.There is lack of submition of data entered in contact page for registraton whereas, location through map can be only seen in online.There are many sections inside the sections which could be difficult to uderstood and apply css propely without full knowledge.<br><br>

	If i had more time then i will be focusing about the implementation of more animation work so that page would look much more interestig then this. Most of the time was wasted for color scheme so it would be great to deal with color if i got more time so that content could look much more greatfull and friendly. I was thinking of making a chat system in this site so such idea would be implemented and lastly rather then giving references to other works like for jps,png file despite i would be making it by myself. </p>
